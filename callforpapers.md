## Workshop Overview

The topic of the workshop lies at the intersection of many of EDBT/ICDT’s topics of interest, including, but not limited to:

- **Availability, reliability, and scalability**
- **Graph data management**
- **Data models and semantics**
- **Knowledge graphs and knowledge management**
- **Query processing and optimisation**
- **Spatial, temporal, and geographic data management**
- **Design and study of data models and query languages**

The workshop sets out to attract researchers, students, and practitioners in data management who have been working on transforming and querying graph data that is prone to evolve with time. The goal is to provide a forum to exchange the challenging research problems posed by designing usable, efficient, and reliable processing techniques in this setting.

# Submission Guidelines

TGD welcomes high-quality research, application, and vision papers. All submissions will be electronic via the Easychair submission system.


## Research Papers

Research papers should describe research ideas and results relevant to TGD’s topics of interest, and that fall into one of the following categories:
- Original and unpublished results, or
- Recent results that have already been accepted or published at an international workshop or conference. These will not count as new publications. If accepted, a short abstract referencing the original publication will be included in the proceedings.

## Application Papers

Application papers are expected to describe graph transformations in the industrial setting or in new application domains. Discussions and lessons concerning technology transfer of research ideas to the real-world setting are particularly encouraged.

## Vision Papers

Vision papers should describe graph transformation use cases/scenarios that push the limits of existing solutions. These should:
- Motivate the importance of the studied use case,
- Present gaps in the state-of-the-art, and
- Lay out directions for addressing these in the future.

TGD workshop 2025 is single-blind: authors must include their names and affiliations.

## Submission Format

- The expected format for submission types is 6 pages in **CEUR Double Column Format**. The font size, margins, inter-column spacing, and line spacing in the template must be kept. 

- Submitted papers violating the length, file type, or formatting requirements will be desk rejected.

- Formatting guidelines for camera ready will follow.

- All TGD papers will be published in the **CEUR online proceedings**, either in full for unpublished works or as short abstracts for submissions summarizing published works. Selected unpublished submissions will be invited to contribute an extended version to a special issue (acceptance pending) of the **Transactions on Graph Data and Knowledge (TGDK) Journal**.
